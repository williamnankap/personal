# AWS CloudFormation templates

This project contains two AWS CloudFormation templates:

* `ec2.yaml`: Creates an EC2 instance with a public IP address and a security group that allows HTTP traffic.
* `network.yaml`: Creates a VPC with a public subnet, a security group that allows HTTP traffic, and an Internet Gateway.

Please note that these templates are just examples and should not be used in production without proper security considerations.
